## International Experience

I love traveling and during my trips abroad, I have met people that come from a completely different culture and have learned a lot about their norms and customs. 

When I visited **Singapore** and **Dubai**, I witnessed people of different nationalities living together and respecting each other. I immensely enjoyed being a part of such an environment. 

During my visit to **Switzerland**, I loved the natural beauty and recall eating tons of chocolate and cheese.

My last trip abroad before covid was to **Bhutan**. The people here were traditional and welcoming. They were extremely proud of their roots. I loved my time here and wish to visit again.

This is a picture of the **Tiger Monastry** in *Bhutan*:
